                        Callback-Based Argument Parser

A small library providing simple callback-based parser for arguments.

This library is meant to be simple to use, and as such doesn't posses any
particularly advanced features (like argument combining) that may result
in complicating its use.

General use:
  CBAP.Register (...);    --
  ...                     -- Register all callbacks you are interested in.
  CBAP.Register (...);    --
  CBAP.Process_Arguments; -- Parse all arguments, calling callbacks if argument
                          -- associated with callback is detected.

See src/cbap.ads file for more detailed description of how library behaves.
